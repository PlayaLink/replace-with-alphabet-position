# replace-with-alphabet-position

A function that, given a string, replaces every letter with its position in the alphabet â€“ where a is 1, b is 2, etc. Anything in the text that isn't a letter is ignored.  


Example:

alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

returns "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" (As a string.)
